## Hello, World

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT UPDATE: Unfortunately I've got caught to this new flu and couldn't code since last week. If you are a recruiter checking my activity on GitHub, please don't disheartened by the pause on my work. Currently my health doesn't allow me much. I've focused on my soft skills and follow-up education on MongoDB at the moment :)
