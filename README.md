### :seedling: Currently studying Professional Software Development in CodeClan

After struggling with self-learning over a year I've joined CodeClan SR10 course. Such a great decision! 

At the beginning I've hesitated a lot. This course is suitable for people who never done coding and I've thought most of the course could be boring while learning all fundamentals over again. But I was wrong. I've been making more practice than I've ever made myself since I've joined CodeClan. There is a huge difference between knowing and doing. You may know lots of things on paper but putting things into practice where you truly develop coding skills and lets you learn more things along the way.

If you ever find yourselves in the same situation, do not hesitate to join CodeClan. You won't regret.

I've already gain more confidence in Python just in 5 weeks. Looking forward to complete Javascript and Java modules.

### :woman_student: CS50 Introduction to Computer Science (2020)

Harvard's best contribution to the tech industry aside from the brilliant stutents they've taught. It's available free to everyone and great place to start learning software development. CS50 helped me a lot to understand the basic communication between machines and humans. I've started with C, which is literarlly my first love in programming languages. Its complexity aside, I love how efficent C to control every single aspect of a program. It may seem hard to write at first but later on I've experienced better eye for bugs after working with C. As you have control over every step, you can easily spot the missing ones.

The second best thing I've learned from CS50 is how to create efficient algorithms. The moment David Malan teared up the phonebook is the one changed my perspective to look programming. I always look for shorter, neater ways to execute my programs since then.

I've also learn the fundamentals of Python in this course. Python may be called as an easy to learn programming language but it's even much easier after C :)

Last but not least I've carved this one rule onto my programming; Never ever repeat your code!
